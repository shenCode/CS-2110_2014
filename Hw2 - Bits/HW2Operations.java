/**
 * HW2 Part 2 - Coding with bitwise operators
 *
 * @author Shen Yang
 * 
 * *** NOTE: The rules are different for each java file! ***
 * 
 * The only things you are allowed to use in your code are the following:
 *	   - The bitwise operators |, &, ~, ^, <<, >>
 *     - Increment and Decrement (++ and --).
 *         - You may also add or subtract 1 from a number, but it must be only 1.
 *     - Boolean operators ||, &&, and !, which are only allowed in if-statements.
 *     - Conditional statements (if, if-else, switch-case, ? :).
 *         - However, you may only handle up to two cases.
 *         - You may only use up to 2 if/else-if statements.
 *     - Equality comparisons (==, !=, <=, >=, <, >).
 *     - The assignment operator (of course).
 *
 * You are not allowed to use anything not mentioned above. This includes the following,
 * but is not an exhaustive list:
 *     - Multiplication or Division
 *     - Addition or Subtraction with numbers other than 1.
 *     - Iteration (for/while/do while) in functions other than toString.
 *     - The unsigned right shift operator >>> (C does not provide this operator).
 *     - Modulus (%).
 *     - Any functions found in Java libraries (especially the Math library).
 *         - Example: Math.pow, Integer.bitCount, etc.
 *     - Casting (you should not have cast anywhere!)
 *     - Switch-case ban, you may not use more than 2 if-statements, or two
 *       case-statements using switch. (see the next point)
 *     - Your code should be concise and simple. None of these functions should be more
 *       than about 5-7 lines of code. If your code is any longer than this, then you are
 *       doing it wrong or inefficiently.
 *
 * Remember that for this assignment, All bit masks must be written in hexadecimal.
 * This is the convention for masks and makes it much easier for the programmer to
 * understand the code. If you write a mask in any other base you will lose points.
 *
 * All of these functions accept ints as parameters because if you pass in a number
 * (which is of type int by default) into a function accepting a byte, then the Java
 * compiler will complain even if the number would fit into that type.
 *    
 * Now, keep in mind the return value is also an int. Please read the comments about how
 * many significant bits to return and make sure that the other bits are not set or else
 * you will not get any points for that test case.
 * i.e if I say to return 6 bits and you return 0xFFFFFFFF, you will lose points.
 *
 * You will only have to worry about the cases we mentioned in the method descriptions.
 *
 * Definitions of types:
 * nibble (nybble) - 4 bits
 * byte - 8 bits
 * short - 16 bits
 * int - 32 bits
