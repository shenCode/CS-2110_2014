Objective: Learning how to code some simple programs in LC-3 Assembly.
 
Don't hesitate to ask the TA's for help. If you are stuck on
one part, or not clear about what it's asking, feel free to
ask. Remember, we are here to help you :)
 
This is not a timed lab so talk with your friends, use the book, use a TA, etc.
 
BE SURE TO ENABLE TRUE TRAPS BEFORE YOU RUN YOUR CODE.
 
Problem 1.
----------
Write a TRAP that multiplies the (positive) values stored in R0 and R1 and puts the result in R0.
 
Specifications
--------------
This trap should be callable by saying TRAP x30 in your code.
 
Preconditions:
R0 and R1 contains the two things you want to multiply together
 
Postconditions:
R0 contains R0 * R1
No other registers (except R7) should be modified (Don't be a goober! ;))
 
Save this program as lab11part1.asm.
 
 
Problem 2.
----------
Write a TRAP that takes in input from the user and echoes it back to them in lowercase.
 
For instance if they type HELLO WORLD! you should echo back hello world!
 
Specifications
--------------
This trap should be callable by saying TRAP x40 in your code.
